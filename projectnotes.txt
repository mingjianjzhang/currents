Syria

Russia has announced a "humanitarian pause" in its bombing of the Syrian city of Aleppo.

I like the pushing and pulling idea...
How would you push... that would just be adding, doing inserts.
Pulling would ... be the same thing, just inserts. 


Right...also the SOCIAL ACTION component ... sigh. A lot of Features


Monthly snapshots
Yearly 

Node?

Daily...TimeGrouped ... CategoryGrouped.

Topics


One Day - Has many nodes

You also want currents... like sub-stories that you can also follow and view the timeline for. 

Categories :

Facts - politics, incidents, etc...
Commentary - Opinion pieces, surveys, overviews, etc...
The "human" side - interviews, clips with people actually there
Art - Fiction/documentaries/films related to the event. 

Should certain pieces be not-time-sensitive? I think everything outside of facts... maybe make that an option? If it's time-sensitive it will be put on the timeline, but if it's not time-sensitive ... where would it go? I guess it could still be attached to that day. But what if someone finds ... and it would be cool if, from the art page, you could also link on links to events that it actually references. Well I guess you want that for every page. 

Also, premade "Courses" for subtopics. 


One snapshot - has many nodes


Admin Side as well
Every Day you will create a new node... or make that optional?
Dashboard should see all push requests.
Snapshot ... last week, voting opens, you can only vote for options on the "OFFICIAL" timeline. 



You also want a nice timeline display.

The key is where does the relation come in, right? Because arab spring preceded syria, that's where the connection would come in, you couldn't say that it "spawned" that crisis, but there would have to be a tie. The tie would be... like a many-to-many table? 
ARAB SPRING -- RELATED TO --- .. ISIS --- RELATED TO --- Crisis in Syria --RELATED TO -- refugee crisis in Europe
Sub Current - Persecution of Yazidis.
But then... you could also elevate the Yazidis to their own current, it just depends on interest I guess.
PERSONAGES
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

    SYRIA:
    	Bashar Al-Assad: president
    	March 2011: Pro-Democracy Protests in Deraa.
    	Hezbollah
    ISLAMIC STATE:
       Intersecting currents
    ARAB SPRING... would be the spawn, right? Cornerstone, but of course you can trace the current even further back. Maybe for this project we stop there.

    NEED TO PICK A BETTER FONT
    Begin with refugee crisis in europe -- syria is not the only place, but makes up a large percentage of it.
    Lead up to syria

    	A MAP API would be nice as well, showing where things happened and when.

10-20

Goals::

Populate 5 nodes with content, just factual, in Syria. OKAY!!!
Get the links to display correctly

10-21
Goals::
THINGS TO TACKLE TODAY:
   Ajax Updates... Let's make the Scope Searches work.
   Tagging Content
   Alternate Views, apart from timeline
   Temporary snapshots... i don't think you even need the snapshots, they are just basically query containers... except for the dates, right, they just make it easier.

   Because you would have to save it in the many_to_many table... could you have a temporary table? not a problem to create the actual snapshots, right? create a temporary snapshot, no the snapshot can't be temporary either because it has to have an id.

i think it's okay... so for example, all western media.
1. find all content with that tag.
2. you still have to group by date at this point. Could do with a while loop, store it in a hash. the data-date would just be the key, okay i think that works.
3. [{ "date" => [content]}, { "date" => [content]}, { "date" => [content]},
data-date = "snapshot.key" 

SNAPSHOTS are for user-curated views, for example, key events in the history of the syrian civil war. So there should be a separate snapshot creation view, with query access to all content_nodes, upon which they can pick and choose, maybe drag and drop to create the right views.

Otherwise.... yeah. it's like an online library. 
Sea

FEATURES:
   Tagging content -- NICEEE

    - Russian Media
    - Syrian - 
    - Other - 
   Search by "current"
   Search by date
   Search by event

   Admin button-menu

Aleppo bombed by fighter planes
Fighter jets have bombed eastern areas of Syria's second city Aleppo
2012-07-24

NEXT STEPS:::
Rewriting queries to not be dependent on snapshots, on content nodes only... shouldn't be TOOOOO Badd..d.???

10/23/16

Implement Searching By Keywords ... check.
Google Books Api is the best... 
Also with information local library availability --- need to learn how to access this stupid API...

Compiling Snapshots, customized timeline views
Cross-Timelines...


Content:
.endOfContent {
    padding-bottom: 40px;
    margin-bottom: 40px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.title {
    margin: 70px 0 20px;
}

BOLD LOOK
Titles cannot be link, 
You need to have sourcing there as well
Hover, and the whole section looks pretty

Line-spacing
Make title clearer
Change fonts for title and content
Icon for every item
Pull the picture from the site, ask for pictures for them to choose from after they post a link

HOME PAGE: 
search over the graph
Node view...graph charts jumping around - that's the main navigation

RIGHT-SIDE: 
search
graph view

TUTORIAL VIEW


For adding content:
do a crawl of page, put in suggested data



10-23-2016
Goals for today...
Get select2 working and active on all selects....
Set up basic user privileges/views
Set up admin privileges.
Set up actions menu/panel
 --- just make it possible to add things.

okay.
FINAL FEATURE SET
Data Entry:
Refugee crisis
Syria
Arab Spring
  Tunisia
  Egypt



<!-- 0. Add image column to each piece of content, do data entry for that as well. <%GOOD JOB%> -->
<!-- 1. make sure that adding content works with no hitches -->
  steps:



2. crawl through links in order to autofill fields
3. Data entry for other timelines, make sure you can do it all through the website
4. Implement collapsible force graph
5. Get keyword searches working
<!-- 6. User curated views - not sure how this is going to work -->
-- Link up with WorldCat for books
-- 
7. User Dashboard...
8. Admin Dashboard ...
  8a) Admin should have to approve user submitted content
9. Snapshots
  9a) "Custom Views" should work on the timeline, with custom groupings
   b) Admins can create snapshots, so then the query is going to be by Snapshots, a group, by title, get all snapshots where name = wooops
10. Make loading animations for all ajax posts
11. Size of forcegraph is based on how much content there is for each graph

REACH GOALS:
12. Cool updating and deleting ... you click on update or delete, the whole screen is grayed out except for content and navigation, then once you click within the div, the option will show to delete or update the selected item.
